# Using-Yolo-algorithm-for-object-detection
In our project, we implemented the YOLO version 1 algorithm for object detection on the Pascal dataset. We followed the
algorithm’s design as outlined in the paper ”You Only Look Once: Unified, Real-Time Object Detection” [(1)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640). The implementation
was carried out using Python and the PyTorch library for training the YOLO model on the Pascal dataset [(2).](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/)
